<h1>How to play mafia game</h1>

<p>


Strategy

I've seen some amazing things in this game. The winners are 
the ones who can convince others that they are innocent or 
ignorant ("What do the cards mean again? I can't remember.") 
when they are really totally on top of the situation. The 
losers are usually the people who are simply asleep at the 
switch ("What do the cards mean again? I can't remember."). 
It's a pretty interesting dynamic. Pay attention & watch 
what works. Being the guy who is trying to direct the 
party will get you lynched but not knowing what is going on is pointless.
The key to staying alive is to stick to the middle of the road. 
The person who tries to accuse someone every turn will draw 
attention to himself. The person who tries to stay perfectly 
quiet will also draw attention to himself. Since every turn 
the players are trying to find someone to lynch, drawing 
attention to yourself is generally a Bad Thing. Likewise, 
it's also important that you not make any noise at night, 
not disrupt the game too much and generally try to go with the flow.
Dying isn't all that bad. You might find it more fun to be 
dead than to be alive because you know who the mafia are; 
certainly you will learn a lot to die early one game. 
Consider nominating yourself. But maybe you shouldn't 
vote for people who nominate themselves since they 
probably aren't mafia -- unless of course the mafia 
has caught onto that point of view in which case you should lynch a few.
As the mafia, kill any player who might be the cop or who 
might suspect you. If the cop reveals himself be sure to 
take him out that night without hesitation. Do not kill 
people only because they accused you, however, as that's a 
bit obvious. A good trick is to viciously accuse your fellow mafia -- 
when people discover he really was mafia you're in the clear 
(unless of course he denounces you). At the end, don't be eager 
to shake hands -- real townspeople are very reluctant to commit themselves.
As the cop you really need to husband your meager resources. 
When you find out who is the mafia, try to get them lynched. 
Keep in mind, however, that admitting you are the cop will get you 
killed for sure. So you have to be persuasive and subtle. Make the 
argument that people who accused the mafia were killed or that the 
mafia player is accusing a lot of people. Try observing for a few 
turns to see if you can get some outward indications. Remember to 
reveal your card if you are about to get lynched. This will get 
you killed but at least you get to tell people what you know, first.
As a townsperson you're pretty much at the mercy of random events. 
Nominate people who make noise at night, are trying to avoid being 
noticed or who seem to have an agenda. In the unlikely event that 
you make it to the end of the game, don't shake hands with anyone 
who is too eager. But also watch for the person who is trying to 
appear reluctant and suspicious. If this advice doesn't 
leave you much choice pick someone at random.

Philosophy

This game is about betrayal. It's about lynching innocents in the 
hope of killing someone bad. It's about convincing people that 
you are a good person when you are really bad. In short, 
it's about a part of the real world (thankfully, not the whole world). 
I think it's an important game in that it provides the players with 
experience in betrayal in a safe game setting so that they can better 
cope in a real situation. Occasionally, I've encountered someone who 
really dislikes this game; pointing out what's it's really about probably won't help...

<h1>THE MAFIA GAME</h1>
<p>The game of Mafia is about convincing others, 
about being able to lie believably, and about being 
able to figure out if other people are lying. 
It will reveal a lot about players to each other, 
and works best if the players know a little bit 
about each other first. It is tremendous fun if 
the players have a sense of humor.
